//* Promise
/* A Promise is an Object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous Operation . It likes you to handle the success or failure of an async operation without getting trapped in a callback hell . 
 
* A Promise has three states:
 Pending: The initial stateâ€”operation has neither completed nor failed.
 Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
 Rejected: The operation failed.
*/

  .finally(() => {
